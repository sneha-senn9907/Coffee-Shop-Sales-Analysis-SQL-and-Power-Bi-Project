# Project Overview:
The Coffee Shop Sales Analysis project aims to analyse coffee shop sales data to gain insights into sales trends, customer behaviour, and identify areas for improvement. Data preprocessing and validation were performed using MySQL, while Power BI was utilized to create interactive dashboards for data visualization and exploration. The project focuses on uncovering sales trends, order patterns, and product performance to aid data-driven decision-making.

# Objectives:
1.	Analyse monthly sales, order volume, and quantity sold trends, including month-over-month growth/decline Compare month-on-month changes in sales, orders, and quantities sold.
2.	Identify sales trends by weekdays, weekends, and store locations.
3.	 Compare actual sales to average sales to identify high and low-performing periods.
4.	Highlight top-performing products and compare sales performance with averages.

# SQL Queries performed:
## 1.Total Sales Analysis: 
## Calculate the total sales for each respective month
      select datename(MM,transaction_date) as Month,round(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price),2) as Total_Sales from Coffee_shop_sales

# Key Findings:
1.	Significant month-on-month fluctuations in total sales and orders were observed.
2.	Peak sales periods were observed on weekdays and during specific 9-11 AM.
3.	Barista Espresso drink was the most popular product category
4.	Calendar heatmaps effectively highlighted high and low sales days, enabling actionable insights for sales optimization.
5.	Analysis of sales by hour and day of the week revealed peak sales times, crucial for staffing and inventory planning.
   
# Conclusions:
The analysis and dashboard provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance, order patterns, and product trends. The findings can be used to optimize operational decisions, such as adjusting staffing levels, refining product offerings, and improving marketing strategies, ultimately improving business efficiency and profitability.
